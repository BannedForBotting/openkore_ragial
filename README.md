[Openkore](https://github.com/OpenKore/openkore) plugin for http://ragi.al/

Config.txt:

    ragial 1
    ragial_timeout 3600


Add `ragial 1` in your config.txt and plugin will compare prices in your shop.txt with ragial and cut it down if needed.
`ragial_timeout` sets timeout to compare prices again.
